The box-shadow property in CSS is used to give a shadow-like effect to the frames of an element. 
The multiple effects can be applied to the elementâ€™s frame which is separated by the comma. 
The box-shadow can be described using X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.
