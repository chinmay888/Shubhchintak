Function/Parameter                Details
rotate(x)                         Defines a transformation that moves the element around a fixed point on the Z axis
translate(x,y)                    Moves the position of the element on the X and Y axis
translateX(x)                     Moves the position of the element on the X axis
translateY(y)                     Moves the position of the element on the Y axis
scale(x,y)                        Modifies the size of the element on the X and Y axis
scaleX(x)                         Modifies the size of the element on the X axis
scaleY(y)                         Modifies the size of the element on the Y axis
skew(x,y)                         Shear mapping, or transvection, distorting each point of an element by a certain angle in
                                  each direction
skewX(x)                          Horizontal shear mapping distorting each point of an element by a certain angle in the
                                  horizontal direction
skewY(y)                          Vertical shear mapping distorting each point of an element by a certain angle in the vertical
                                  direction
matrix()                          Defines a 2D transformation in the form of a transformation matrix.
                                  angle
                                  The angle by which the element should be rotated or skewed (depending on the function
                                  with which it is used). Angle can be provided in degrees (deg), gradians (grad), radians (rad)
                                  or turns (turn). In skew() function, the second angle is optional. If not provided, there will be
                                  no (0) skew in Y-axis.
