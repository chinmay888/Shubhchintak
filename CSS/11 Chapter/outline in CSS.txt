Outline is a line that goes around the element, outside of the border. In contrast to border, outlines do not take any
space in the box model. So adding an outline to an element does not affect the position of the element or other
elements.
In addition, outlines can be non-rectangular in some browsers. This can happen if outline is applied on a span
element that has text with different font-size properties inside it. Unlike borders, outlines cannot have rounded
corners.
The essential parts of outline are outline-color, outline-style and outline-width.
