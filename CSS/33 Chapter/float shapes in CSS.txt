Parameter                            Details
none                                 A value of none means that the float area (the area that is used for wrapping content around a float
                                     element) is unaffected. This is the default/initial value.
basic-shape                          Refers to one among inset(), circle(), ellipse() or polygon(). Using one of these functions and its
                                     values the shape is defined.

shape-box                            Refers to one among margin-box, border-box, padding-box, content-box. When only <shape-box> is
                                     provided (without <basic-shape>) this box is the shape. When it is used along with <basic-shape>, this
                                     acts as the reference box.
 image                               When an image is provided as value, the shape is computed based on the alpha channel of the image
                                     specified.
