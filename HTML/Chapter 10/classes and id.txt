Classes and IDs make referencing HTML elements from scripts and stylesheets easier. The class attribute can be
used on one or more tags and is used by CSS for styling. IDs however are intended to refer to a single element,
meaning the same ID should never be used twice. IDs are generally used with JavaScript and internal document
links, and are discouraged in CSS.


Classes can be repeated in the same document.
But id cannot be duplicated.
Also,  having same class for different elements can be useful or create unusual errors in the document.
