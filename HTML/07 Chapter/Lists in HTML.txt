HTML offers three ways for specifying lists: ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists. Ordered lists use
ordinal sequences to indicate the order of list elements, unordered lists use a defined symbol such as a bullet to list
elements in no designated order, and description lists use indents to list elements with their children. This topic
explains the implementation and combination of these lists in HTML markup.
