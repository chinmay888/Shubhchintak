Section 1.1 Usage of console:
console.log("Type message here") prints the message.

It can also be used to display stored variables.
var hi = "test"
console.log(hi)

We can log two or more variables, we can use comma to seperate them.
var hi = "test1"
var bye = "test2"
console.log(hi,bye)

We can log objects too, which is useful for API calls
console.log({
'Email' : '123@gmail.com',
'Name' : 'Test',
})

We can also log HTML components, such as body or head etc.
console.log(document.body)
