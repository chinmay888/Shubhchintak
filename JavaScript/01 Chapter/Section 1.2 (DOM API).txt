DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is an object-oriented representation of structured documents like XML
e.g we have a paragraph with id "ok"
<p id="ok"></p>
We dont have any text in it. To manipulate it or add text in it, we can type
document.getElementbyId("ok").textContent = "test"
The first line of code will now be seen as 
<p id="ok">test<p/>

We can also do this same for manipulating the body tags
